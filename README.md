There are many ways one can categorize the mails, one common way is to categorize all the emails into seperate folders in the order of their priority.
However, this is more of a hassle where you need to check each folder to lookout for the email wrongly categorized, which could have been important you.
The idea of 3 word email is not to categorize but to summarize the contents mostly to 3 words, which along with the senders name and email address should be
a good indicator of whether the email is worth your time or not. Lastly to read the complete rendered email you can click on the card to view the email. This mechanism puts you in charge, where you decide which email is worthy of your time to read in depth. This can be a good excercise to do in the mornings where you can glance over the 3 words of each mail, decide which ones are important to you at that moment and read it at that moment.
This email app is not a replacement for the traditional email clients, but rather a companion which does not overwhelm you with lots of information, which does not
make categorization decisions for you, but lets you exercise that in a productive manner.

Another great feature to reduce the anxiety from lots of emails is time based filter options available on the top of the main screen. This ensures that you do not
get caught up Looking at old/irrelevant emails repeateadly.
